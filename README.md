##Lab 1- File Handling
###Objective: Handling csv file without any libraries and using only inbuilt and user defined functions.
###Main Function Used:
###1)Used open function to access the csv file and to manipulate it in the further program.
###2)Using file.readline() to printing the header of the csv file.
###3)Made a user defined function called maritalcount() which is reading csv file and storing it in the list.It then iterates over the list and splits each rows into ###a list of values.The second values in each row is the marital status of the customer.The code then creates a dictionary that maps each marital status to the ###number of customers with that status the function finally prints the total.
###4) It is created by dividing the range of ages into a number of bins, and then counting the number of customers in each bin. The height of each bar in the ###histogram represents the number of customers in that bin.The code first opens the CSV file and reads the header row. It then skips the next row, which contains ###the column names. The remaining rows of the file contain the data for each customer. The code iterates over these rows, and for each row, it extracts the age of ###the customer. The age is then used to determine which bin it belongs to. The code then increments the count for that bin.
###Once all of the rows have been processed, the code prints the histogram. The histogram is printed as a table
